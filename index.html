<h3>My projects</h3>
<P>My first project is about Early Marriages.</P> 
<P>According to the Georgian legislation legal marriage age is 17 and it 
    happens with the consent of biological parents, adoptive parents or guardians. 
    n Georgia kidnapping a girl is not a tradition, it is a crime. However, there are 
    still cases when kidnapping for marriage is considered to be part of the tradition 
    and is taken as something simple and acceptable by many people. Those cases are happening 
    around me, in my homeland Georgia, in Javakheti region and in my small villageâ€¦</P>

<p>My second project is about Pilgrimage to Ablar.</p>
<p>Ablar village belongs to Kulikam village and is located 3 km to the northeast of the village. 
    One of the first mentions of the medieval village in written sources dates back to 1595,
     as a village free from rayas and paying a tax of 2,500 points. The half-ruined, one-nave church 
     (11.50-6.11m) and the cemetery have been preserved in the Ablar area. In the latter,
     there are pedestals of quadrangular pillars and ram-shaped tombstones.</p>
