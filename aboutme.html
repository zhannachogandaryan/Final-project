    <h3>My Story</h3> 
    <section class="larg-text">
   <p>Hello, I'm Zhanoolik, a 21-year-old student currently residing in the 
        enchanting city of Tbilisi. Over the past four years, I've embarked on a remarkable journey
         of self-discovery and academic pursuit in a society foreign to my own.</p>
         <br>
    <p>Upon my arrival, the Georgian language was entirely unfamiliar to me. 
        However, fueled by determination, I swiftly mastered the language, facilitating 
        my integration into the vibrant Georgian society. Securing admission to the university, 
        with the added triumph of passing state exams and receiving full funding,
         marked the realization of my initial goal.</p>
         <br>
    <p>In the subsequent year, I eagerly embraced the challenges of a
         new university, and once again, I emerged triumphant. Currently,
          I find myself engaged in the unique experience of simultaneously 
          studying at two universities, all while enjoying the camaraderie of diverse 
        friendships with fellow students from various national backgrounds.</p>
        <br>

    <p>Yet, this journey has not been without its share of difficulties. Living far from my family, 
        I often yearn for the comforting embrace of my mother and the familiar warmth of familial bonds.
         However, the realization that such reunions are currently 
        unattainable serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made in pursuit of my dreams.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Through these four years, I have not only expanded my academic horizons but also cultivated
         linguistic diversity. I am proficient in four languages, with a fifth currently under study.
          Looking ahead, I am actively engaged in various activities,
         including training sessions and contributing to a social enterprise alongside a dedicated team.</p>
         <br>
    <p>While the dream of reuniting with my family remains a poignant one,
         the fulfillment of academic and personal goals propels me forward. 
         I am Zhanoolik, a resilient student embracing the challenges and triumphs 
         of a life shaped by determination, cultural immersion, and a commitment to 
         a future filled with diverse opportunities. </p>
